# NxtVR

NxtVR is our first open source VR headset!

<short story about NxtVR, will be added soon.>

In the HidTracker_MPU6050 you can find all the needed files for using an MPU6050 as a tracker with the STM32. We are highly working on bringing an affordable 9DOF tracker, using the BMX055. We actually have a fork from the Fabo library, in which we are putting hard work for making it compatible with the STM32.
