<h4 align="center">The Raspberry Pi Pico based VR headset that you can build yourself for less than €75!</h4>

# NxtVR

The Vis3r NxtVR project has been in development for some time now, but like everyone and everything, it has suffered from the Covid-19 virus lockdown.

We spent ages searching for the right hardware to build the sensor around, but it was surprisingly hard going. When the Raspberry Pi Pico was released, it was immediately obvious that it was absolutely perfect for what we needed, and that our search was over. Our goal has always been to create an open source VR headset that absolutely anyone could build themselves, from scratch, quickly, easily and affordably. All it should require was a bare minimum of hardware skills, a bare minimum of software skills, and access to a 3D Printer. The Raspberry Pi Pico gives everyone this chance, and forms the heart of the NxtVR VR Headset. 

# Getting Started
## What you'll need
### 3D models

The 3D models can be found in this repository. We have provided STL files, so anyone can immediately start printing. We have also provided the original CAD files in various popular formats, so the more adventurous among you can do whatever you need to them. Whilst it's impossible to say how long it will take to print it out on your printer, there are two main components that will take  5 to 10 hours each, along with a few other pieces that may take an hour or two each and a few fittings that will take minutes.
